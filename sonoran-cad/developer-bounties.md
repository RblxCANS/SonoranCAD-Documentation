        <p>Live unit tracking in-game based on a call&apos;s primary unit.</p>
        <p>There is a toggle in-cad by the primary unit that will add a <code>metaData.trackPrimary</code> flag
          to the call.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Tracking data should be handled on the community server side. Additional
          commands can be added to set yourself as the primary unit on the call,
          or enable tracking.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This will aid in common police chases by auto-routing the GPS on attached/responding
          officers to the primary officer&apos;s location.</p>

        <p>The Wraith radar will display a vehicle registration&apos;s <code>status</code> on
          the UI.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Communities should be able to set a config option (<code>statusFieldUid</code>)
          to pull a custom status field&apos;s value. The plugin will then search
          vehicle registrations for a matching field UID and pull the status value
          from it.
          <br />
          <br />This will allow communities with custom records to display custom values
          like &quot;Stolen&quot; on the automated plate reader flags.</p>
