## Setting the Language In-App

Sonoran CAD will attempt to automatically detect your local language. However, you can manually set your language preferences in the side menu's "Settings" modal.

## Add or Improve Translations

Our translation support is made possible by community contributions.

If you would like to add additional support for your local language, please submit a PR to our [GitHub ](https://github.com/Sonoran-Software/sonorancad_translations)language repository. Or, join our [Discord ](http://discord.sonorancad.com/)and claim for the community development and testing role in the `#request-role` channel.
