### Configuring your Listener

#### 1. Admin Panel Configuration

In the admin panel, navigate to: Advanced &gt; In-Game Integration  
Expand the "Server Events and Integrated Live Map" section.

Enter your server's public IP address and your new listener port. By default, this is port `3232`.  
Learn more about [configuring multiple servers](../../../tutorials/customization/configuring-multiple-servers.md).

#### 2. Framework Configuration and Installation

Ensure you have **port forwarded** your new listener port. By default, this is port `3232`.  
You will need to download and install the [`pushevents`](../../../integration-plugins/integration-plugins/available-plugins/push-events.md) plugin installed in order to receive the events.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You will need to properly port forward your listener port.  
If you are unsure how to do this, you will need to **contact your hosting provider**.
