# Registering Your Community

_NOTE:_ If you have not already, you will need to [create a user account](registering-your-account.md) with Sonoran CAD.

#### 1. Enter In Your Community Information

Once logged in, press "Create Community" on the community selection menu.\
You will be prompted for three information fields:

1. Community ID
2. Community Name
3. Website (Optional)

{% hint style="info" %}
Your community ID is a unique identifier for your community. This is what users will use to sign into your specific CAD. Typically, it is the abbreviation of your community.\
EX: Arizona Serious Roleplay - ID: AZSRP
{% endhint %}

![The community CAD registration modal is shown as above](../../.gitbook/assets/new_community.png)

#### 2. Register Your Community

Once you've filled out the information, press "Register Community" to create your CAD.\

Your community icon will now be displayed under the "My Communities" section. You can click on this to log into your new CAD.
