2. [Quick Resize](customizing-your-layout.md#2-quick-resize): This opens the quick resize tools for the window.
3. Minimize: This minimizes the window to a tab at the top of your screen.
4. Close: This closes the window.

### 2. Quick Resize

Windows can be resized and positioned in multiple ways:

You can select one of the quick positions to move the window to one of the 9 quadrants on your screen. Or, toggle "Show Advanced" to specify the window's dimensions and positions down to the pixel.

Additionally, you can hover over the top edges of the window to click and drag the size.

### 3. Dragging to Position

Popout windows like a lookup, 10-code sheet, etc. can all be easily dragged and resized using the top header in addition to the quick resize tools.

Popout windows with in quick resize enabled or unlocked required windows \(dispatch call editor, etc.\) can be dragged simply by clicking and dragging anywhere on the window.

### 4. Locking/Unlocking

When a window is locked into place it can no longer be moved. Additionally, the size and positioning is saved locally to your device and will persist after a refresh or relog. You can lock or unlock the window by right clicking on the window.

### 5. Reset Layouts

If something goes wrong or you just want to start fresh, you can reset your saved layouts in the settings menu.
