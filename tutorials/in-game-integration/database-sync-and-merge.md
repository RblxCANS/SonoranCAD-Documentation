# Database Sync and Merge

{% hint style="info" %}
Database Sync is not enabled with the free version of Sonoran CAD.  
For more information, see our [pricing](https://sonorancad.com/app/#/pricing) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Database Sync is a read-only system. All characters, licenses, and vehicle registrations pulled from your database can not be modified in the CAD.  
  
Database Merge allows you to save off additional, manually specified data in the CAD.

## Video Configuration Tutorial

## Written Configuration Guide

Configuring Sonoran CAD's Database Sync may seem complicated, but you are simply specifying your table names and column values.

REQUIRED fields in the CAD are shown in red. All other fields are optional, and are not required to work properly.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Connection Credentials" %}
### Connection Credentials

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sonoran CAD requires an **external** connection to your database.  
  
If you're unsure what your connection credentials are, it is highly recommended to first successfully connect to your database on **your own, external PC** first with a database viewer like [HediSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/). These same credentials will then work with Sonoran CAD.  
  
You will also need to ensure your database port is open and port forwarded. Typically, port`3306`is the default MySQL port.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Sonoran CAD never needs any permissions to write to your database.  
To follow the best security practices, it's recommended to create a new MySQL user with read-only permissions on your database tables.
{% endhint %}

In order for Sonoran CAD to connect to your SQL database, connection credentials must be configured properly.  
This section specifies the SQL connection string information.

#### 1. Toggle the “Enable Database Sync”

#### 2. Enter the required fields below.

![Sonoran CAD&apos;s Database Sync connection configuration](../../.gitbook/assets/sync_connection.png)

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Field</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Type</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">This is the type of SQL database your server is using (MySQL, PostgreSQL,
        etc.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Host/Address</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>This is the <b>external </b>IP address or domain address to your SQL database.
          <br
          />
        </p>
        <p><em>Note:</em> This IP will never be <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code>.
          This must be the external IP or domain to reach your database. See the
          warnings/notices above on creating an external connection.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Port</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">This is the port your database is accessible from. Typically, the default
        port for MySQL is 3306.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Database</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">This is the database or schema name that contains your community&#x2019;s
        character, license and vehicle registration tables.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Username</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">This is the SQL account username.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Password</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">This is the password for the SQL account.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### 3. Test the Connection

Once the required SQL connection fields have been specified, select the “Test Connection” button.  
This will query your database for the version.  
  
If you see an alert similar to the following, your connection is successful:

![Database Sync connection credentials successfully entered](../../.gitbook/assets/db_connected.png)

#### 4. Save the Configuration

If the test was successful, press “Save Connection Credentials” and continue.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Character Mapping" %}

{% tab title="Advanced - JSON" %}
### Advanced - JSON

Some communities may store values in a JSON column. The following example pulls the `color` key value from a JSON column named `vehicleinfo`.

```javascript
// Example of JSON column "vehicleinfo"
{
    "color": "Red",
    "type": "SUV",
    "somethingElse": "Some Value"
}
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Friendly Mapping" %}
### Friendly Mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
Friendly Mapping requires the **Pro** version of Sonoran CAD.  
For more information, see our [pricing](https://sonorancad.com/app/#/pricing) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

Friendly mapping allows you to convert any raw database value to a more user friendly value.  
Ex: `drive_license` in your database is converted to `Driver's License`.

#### 1. Open the Friendly Mapping Editor

In the Friendly Mapping column, press the `MODIFY` button.

![Sonoran CAD - Database Sync Friendly Mapping](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2879%29.png)

#### 2. Configure the New Friendly Mapping

Enter the new raw database value and the friendly value you would like to convert it to.  
Ex: A civilian character's `JOB` being changed from the raw DB value of `ambulance` to `EMT`.  
Ex: A license record's `TYPE` bring changed from the raw DB value of `drive_license` to `Driver's License`.

![Sonoran CAD - Database Sync Friendly Mapping Editor](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2880%29.png)

#### 3. Save the Configuration

Press `SAVE` in the friendly mapping editor.
