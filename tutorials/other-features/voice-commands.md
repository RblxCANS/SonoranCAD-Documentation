# Voice Commands

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently, Sonoran CAD only supports voice commands in the **Chrome desktop browser**. 

Voice recognition is provided by Google, and performance may vary based upon pronunciation, speed, and other factors.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Enable Microphone Access

When navigating to a page with voice commands enabled, the browser will prompt you for microphone access.

![Enable microphone access](../../.gitbook/assets/voice_allow.png)

### 2. Ensure Your Microphone is being Received

Now that microphone access has been granted, a red circle will appear at the top right of the browser tab.
