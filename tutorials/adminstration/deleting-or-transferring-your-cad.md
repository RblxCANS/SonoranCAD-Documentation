Once you have chosen an option, you will be **required** to verify your email. \(This will be the email you originally signed up for the CAD with.\) After verification, your CAD/Community will be either deleted or transferred. This will be based off the option you chose earlier.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Once a CAD is deleted, there is NO WAY for us to recover it. Please consider this before making your choice.
