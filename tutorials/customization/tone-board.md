# Tone Board

{% hint style="info" %}
The tone board is limited based upon your community's version.  
For more information, see our [pricing](../../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

## Customizing Tones

### 1. Access the Customization Menu

In the admin page, navigate to `Customization` &gt; `Customization` &gt; `Tone Board`

![Sonoran CAD - Tone Board Customization](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28199%29.png)

### 2. Customize the Available Tones

Here, you can add new tones and specify the following:

* Tone Label
* Tone Link/URL \(Direct uploading available based on your [version](../../pricing/faq/)\)
* Tone Button Color \(Hex\)
* Tone Button Icon

#### Tone Icons

Tone buttons support icons from several different web libraries. Clicking the search icon will open the Font Awesome icon library search. Here, you can search for an icon - click on it - and paste the icon name into the CAD.

#### Save your Tones

Don't forget to press save!

## Playing Tones as Dispatch

### Opening the Tone Board Window

The tone board can be opened by users in dispatch or self-dispatch mode.

From the start menu, this panel is located under `Dispatch` &gt; `Tone Board` 

This window can also be opened via a [custom hotkey](../other-features/configurable-hotkeys.md), also supported with our [Streamdeck Integration](../../integration-plugins/stream-deck-integration.md).

The window can also be minimized, and [pinned to the taskbar](customizing-your-layout.md#7-tab-system) on your screen for quick access.

### Tone Board Shortcuts

The tone board is designed to be as efficient as possible.

#### Search Filtering

The top of the tone board includes a search box, allowing you to quickly filter tone options as you type.  
If you filter down the options to a single tone, the search label will turn green - allowing you to press `ENTER` to play the tone.

The tone board is also designed to auto-focus this search box whenever it is opened, or the header is clicked.

![Tone Board - Filtering](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28198%29.png)

#### Hotkey Auto-Window

[Global hotkeys](../other-features/configurable-hotkeys.md) allow you open the tone board in a more advanced way. Opening the tone board with your [keyboard ](../other-features/configurable-hotkeys.md)or [Streamdeck ](../../integration-plugins/stream-deck-integration.md)shortcut will first check for any existing tone board window opened or minimized. If one is found, that existing window will be opened and focused to the search bar. Otherwise, a new tone board window will be opened with the search box focused.

#### Manual Tone Select

Instead of using the search filtering, users can also manually click the tone board button to play the audio.
