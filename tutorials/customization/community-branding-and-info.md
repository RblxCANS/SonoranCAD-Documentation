# Community Branding and Settings

{% hint style="warning" %}
Community customization requires the **standard** version of Sonoran CAD or higher.  
For more information, see our [pricing](https://sonorancad.com/app/#/pricing) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

### Community Information

The admin customization info section allows you to customize your community's image, name, timezone, and more!

### Community ID

Looking to change your community ID?  
Navigate to Admin &gt; Advanced &gt; Change Community ID

![Sonoran CAD&apos;s Community ID Change](../../.gitbook/assets/change_com_id.png)

Here, you can enter in and request a new community ID.  
Once submitted, you will be logged out. All active community members will also need to log out and back in to avoid any issues.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If your community has an active subscription, you will automatically be downgraded to the free version.

To transfer the subscription to the new community ID, update your community ID by pressing "Modify" on the active subscription in the [payment center](../../pricing/faq/accessing-the-payment-center.md).
