# Custom Login Page

{% hint style="info" %}
Custom login pages are not supported with the free version.  
For more information, see our [pricing](../../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Looking for VPS, web, or dedicated hosting? Check out our official [server hosting](../../pricing/vps-hosting.md)!
{% endhint %}

The custom login page allows your community members to register, sign-in, and access your CAD all on your own domain!

#### 3. Host the HTML File

Now that you've saved the custom URL inside of the HTML file, you can host this with your own domain on your own web server. Users can now register and access your CAD from your custom domain, and will even receive your [custom branded emails](custom-emails.md) for account actions.
