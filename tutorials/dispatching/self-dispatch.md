# Self Dispatch

{% hint style="info" %}
Self Dispatch requires an additional user account permission!

Users will need the "Self Dispatch" permission to enable this feature. View our guide on [granting account permissions](../getting-started/permissions.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

### Enable Self-Dispatch

In the top right of the call viewer, select "Self Dispatch"
