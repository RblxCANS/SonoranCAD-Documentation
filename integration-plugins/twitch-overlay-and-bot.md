## What is Sonoran CAD's Livestream Overlay?

Sonoran CAD has a built-in livestream overlay, allowing you to display your live unit information, call information, and more!

Our Twitch bot can also be configured to send out chat messages when data is modified.



## Configuring the Overlay

The overlay is immensely customizable, allowing you to customize every piece of data displayed.

### 1. Access the Overlay

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to configure and save your overlay layout in a regular web browser. This layout is saved on the account level and will be persisted to your OBS browser window.
{% endhint %}

While using the OBS browser, In the police, fire, or EMS page select the "Stream Overlay" button in the taskbar.  
This can be found under `System` &gt; `Stream Overlay` or by searching for it in the search bar.

### 2. Customize the Data and Font

The overlay has multiple window types. The `Unit & Call Data` window can display customizable unit and call data. The `Call Notes` window will display the live notes section of your attached call.

To add a window, select `New` &gt; {Window Type}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The free version of the stream overlay is designed for trialing. This is limited to three \(3\) live data keys and one \(1\) Unit & Call Data window type. The Twitch bot is also unavailable with the free version.

### 3. Customize the Window

Each window can also have a customizable background. You can set the color with a HEX or RGB code.  
Or, use custom CSS for the `background` property.

Ex: `linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(228,0,54,1) 0%, rgba(149,0,228,1) 35%);`

### 5. Save your Layout

Make sure you SAVE your layout. This layout configuration is saved on the account level, and will persist to your stream layout loaded in OBS.

### 6. Adding the Overlay to OBS

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) is recommended for use of this overlay, but other stream casting software may also be used. The browser source type supports native transparency, and can even update in the background while minimized.

In OBS, add a new `Browser` source.

Set the URL to `https://sonorancad.com` and customize the `Width` and `Height` properties to your screen size.

### 7. Interact with the Browser Source

In OBS, right click on your new browser source to "interact" with it on the screen. By running the browser source through OBS, native transparency will be supported and processing can run in the background.

Then, login to Sonoran CAD as you normally would. Access the police, fire, or EMS page and enable the stream overlay mode.

![OBS - Browser Interaction](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28233%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: In the OBS browser, be sure to set the community as your default in the community menu.  
  
Then, overlay will automatically resume when reloaded.
{% endhint %}

### 8. Start the Overlay

You can toggle on `Stream Mode` in the top toolbar. This will hide the toolbar on your stream.

Once a window is locked, the data will be displayed and update in real-time. You can now use Sonoran CAD on your regular web, desktop, or mobile app and watch the OBS browser window update.

To unlock a window, right-click and select `Unlock Window`.

## Configuring the Twitch Bot

Sonoran CAD's stream overlay also comes with a configurable Twitch bot. This bot will send out chat updates when unit or call data is updated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Twitch bot is not included with the free version of the Stream Overlay.

### 3. Configure the Bot's Event Data

Every piece of unit and call data can be toggled on or off individually.

**It is highly recommended to only toggle on data updates that will not be frequently spammed.** Toggling too many data fields and updating data too quickly may result in **Twitch rate limiting your bot.**

### 4. Save and Run

Once you have configured your Twitch Bot's credentials and data fields, press `Save`.

Now, whenever one of those data fields is updated, your Twitch bot will send a chat message.
