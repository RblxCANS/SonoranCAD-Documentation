# Discord Rich Presence

{% hint style="info" %}
Rich presence is included with all versions of Sonoran CAD, but customization requires the **Standard** plan or higher.  
For more information, see our [pricing](../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../tutorials/getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

## What is Discord Rich Presence?

When running our [desktop application](../downloads/), Discord can automatically detect and display information about your community.
