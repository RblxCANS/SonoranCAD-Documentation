# Getting Started - Discord Bot

## Inviting the Bot

{% hint style="danger" %}
Invite link is currently unavailable due to the bot undergoing testing.
{% endhint %}

To get started, you must invite the bot to your Discord, which you can do by clicking this link. You must have the "Manage Server" permission to add bots; plus any permissions the bot requires to function.

### Bot Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
Setting up the bot requires you to have Administrator permissions on the Discord server for security reasons. You must also have access to your server's [API Key information](../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/retrieving-your-credentials.md).
{% endhint %}

1. When the bot joins your server, it will attempt to post a message to the "System Channel" that the server has. If unset, the bot will do nothing. 
2. To begin the setup process, type `!setup` in any channel the bot has access to. You will be sent a direct message \(DM\) with instructions. **Be sure DMs are enabled**!
3. Follow the prompts from the bot to finish the setup process.

### Commands Reference

By default, the bot uses the `!` prefix for all commands. This can be changed with the `setprefix` command, as noted below.

#### That's it!

See the [Features](features/) section for instructions on how to use the various features of the Bot.
